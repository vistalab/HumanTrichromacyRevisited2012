% Figure caption:
% Figure 2. Quadratic model fitting to foveal measurements.  (A) Threshold
% measurements and ellipses estimated by a quadratic model in subject 1
% (S1). We fit the sampled measurements using a quadratic model with three
% mechanisms as defined by the row size of the opponent-mechanism matrix,
% V3x4. The model (black solid line) fits the measurements well (black
% filled circles). Measurement points are shown only if they lie near the
% displayed plane (cosine of the angle between the point and the plane is
% more than 0.95). Upper panels show planes including the cone-silent axis
% (Z: zero-cone) and one of the L-, M-, or S cone pigment axes. The
% photopigment densities are assumed to match the standard color observer
% (see main body). Note that a subject could detect a cone-silent stimulus
% at 2% stimulus modulation. Lower panels show planes consisting of L-, M-,
% and S- cone pigments axes. The ellipses on the cone-pigment planes are in
% good agreement with the color-science literature. The threshold to detect
% L+M light is much higher than L-M and the threshold in the S- direction
% is lower than the L+M threshold. (B) Threshold ellipses and measurements
% estimated in subject 2 (S2). Thresholds are generally lower than those of
% S1. However, the shapes of the ellipses are similar to S1.
